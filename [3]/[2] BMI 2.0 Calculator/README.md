# BMI 2.0 Calculator

The purpose of this task is to enhance the calculator that we created before so that we can implement conditionals.
### Skills
  - Understand how to use Python user input and also change the data type from String to float and use a temporary variable instead of doing it in one line.
  - Use Python notation for power functions.
  - Print using // to indicate rounding.
  - Use conditionals to print out statements based on the BMI.
