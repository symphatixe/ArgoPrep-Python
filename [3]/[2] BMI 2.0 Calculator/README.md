# BMI 2.0 Calculator
The purpose of this task is to enhance the BMI calculator that we created before so that we can implement conditionals.

### Skills
  - Understand how to use Python user input, cast the data type from string to float and use a temporary variable instead of casting in place.
  - Use Python notation `**` for exponents.
  - Print using `//` to indicate floor division.
  - Use conditionals and relational operators to print out statements based on the BMI.
