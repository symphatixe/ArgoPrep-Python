# Love Calculator
The purpose of this task is to calculate the love score between two names based on an arbitrary scale of counting how many times each letter from "true love" appears within the two names. Scores greater than 90 or less than 10 are good scores, scores between 40 and 50 are okay, and other scores aren't good at all.

### Skills 
- User user input to combine both names and use `lower()` to simplify calculations.
- Use `count()` to count the occurence of letters within a string.
- Cast the two scores as strings to concatenate them:
    - true = 1
    - love = 1
    - love score = 11, not 2.
- Use the keywords and & or to create conditionals for the love scores.
- Print out the love scores using a f-string and their description.
