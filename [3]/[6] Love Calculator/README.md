# Love Calculator
The purpose of this task is to calculate the love score between two names based on an arbitrary scale of counting how many times each letter in "true love" appears within the two names. Scores greater thant 90 or less than 10 are good scores, scores between 40 and 50 are okay, and other scores aren't good at all.

### Skills 
- User user input and combine two names and make sure to lowercase both of them so that calculations are easier.
- How to use methods to count how many times a letter occurs within a string.
- Cast the two scores as strings to find the combination of them
    - true = 1
    - love = 1
    - love score = 11, not 2.
