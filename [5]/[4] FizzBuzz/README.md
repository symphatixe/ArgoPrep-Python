# FizzBuzz 
The purpose of this task is to recreate the very simple and almost infamous FizzBuzz problem.

### Skills
- Use a for loop to loop over numbers 1 - 100 to determine which of the three possible choices should be printed:
    - `Fizz` if divisible by 3
    - `Buzz` if divisible by 5
    - `FizzBuzz` if divisible by both 3 and 5
- Use conditionals and nested conditionals to determine which choice is printed and check the divisibility.
- Another difficulty meter, is to allow Python user input to determine a print statement based on the user input.
